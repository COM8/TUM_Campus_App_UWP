# Privacy Policy:
## GPS:
Your position only gets used to calculate the distance between you and the next canteen.
It's not necessary, but it's recommend, that you give the app access to your current position.

## TUMonline:
Your TUMonline information only gets processed and saved (via ApplicationDataContainer) locally on your device.
They're used to display you your calendar, grades, lectures, ... on your device without having to always log in to TUMonline.
If you don't want to give the app access to your personal information, you can disable this via the token manager in TUMonline.
The app accesses your data via the TUMonline WEB-API, using the requested token.
